            <p>Your privacy is important to us. As a 501(c)(3) organization, we are not subject to rules set forth in the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), but we are still committed to providing its protections to our users. Here are some ways that your information may be used on this site.
